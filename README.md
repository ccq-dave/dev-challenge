Front End Web Development Challenge
===================

To better assess a candidates development skills, we would like to provide the following challenge.

Project description
-------------------

We want to develop a small web app that displays a list of volunteers.

First of all we'll display the list of people by fetching data from the  [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). The app should show at least 10 profiles.

Each profile should be displayed with the following minimum data available

*  Name
* Email
* Phone
* Profile Image

Clicking on a  profile should show more detailed information.

You can use any library/framework/plugins you want.

The application must be single page and JS-based. That means that I load just one html file, if you want to add any navigation it must be implemented via JS.

Evaluation
----------

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

* Do you understand the JavaScript language and other more general web technologies?
* Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?
* Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?

Consider the followings:

* It is NOT expected that you will spend excessive amounts of time working on this.
* It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.
* We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome (Chromium).
